#  Xatu's Prophecy â€“ Palmistry App

**Xatu's Prophecy** is a fun and interactive palmistry app built with Python using the Kivy framework and OpenCV. It allows users to capture an image of their palm via webcam and analyzes key palm linesâ€”**Heart Line**, **Head Line**, **Life Line**, and **Fate Line**â€”based on contour detection and line length.

Each line is interpreted with a unique, randomized message depending on its detected length, offering a mystical and entertaining experience.
